  <h2>Leader Psychology and Involvement in International Events</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association. San Diego. April 1-4, 2012</li>
<li><em>Louisiana State University Honors College Outstanding Honors Thesis Award</em></li>
</ul>


<p>In this paper, I explore a previously under-examined area of the international conflict literature: involvement in international events. I argue that to
fully understand the causal processes at work in international conflict, it is necessary to understand what drives a leader to act in the first place,
regardless of what type of action, cooperative or conflictual, a leader chooses. Towards this end, I make use of two event datasets, WEIS and COPDAB,
to determine how many events the United States pursues in a given month. In addition, I argue that two psychological variables, Conceptual Complexity
and Self-Confidence, have a significant impact on the number of events a leader pursues. After an extensive review of the literatures surrounding these
two variables, I derive new hypotheses relating to each, and offer a new interpretation of Conceptual Complexity that has not yet been examined. Using
quantitative measures of these two concepts drawn from the Leadership Trait Analysis framework, I find that statistical models provide support for the
hypotheses offered. The findings of this paper contribute to both the international conflict and political psychology literatures. The findings provide
a richer understanding of the processes underlying foreign-policy decision making and serve as a basis for further research in the field of political
psychology to determine what causal impact these two variables have on the international behavior of elites.</p>

<h2>Changes in Leader Psychology and the Response to Crisis Onset</h2>

<ul>
<li>with John Robert Butler.</li>
<li>Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association-Midwest. St. Louis, MO. November 10-13, 2011</li>
<li>Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Louisiana Political Science Association. February 24-25, 2012</li>
<li><em>Winner of the International Studies Association-Midwest Margaret G. Hermann Award for Best Paper Using Text Analysis</em></li>
<li><em>Winner of the Louisiana Political Science Association’s Undergraduate Student Research Award for Best Undergraduate Paper</em></li>
</ul>


<p>This paper examines the role that a change in a leader’s self-confidence has in determining how said leader responds to the onset of a crisis. This
question, what role does a change in psychology have, is one that has been unanswered in the current literature. By making use of modern at-a-distance
techniques we examine the psychology of leaders in 54 crisis situations, as defined by the International Crisis Behavior dataset. Specifically, we
examine whether the change models or static models have greater explanatory power. We then assess and compare what impact the change and static models
have on the likelihood that a leader will choose aggression as the response to a crisis onset. We find strong support for the use of change variables in
conflict research, and uncover interesting effects when change and static variables are combined. Finally, we discuss what these findings mean for the
future of political psychology research in specific, and international conflict research in general.</p>

<h2>Effects of Presidential Psychology on Militarized Interstate Disputes from 1945-2001</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association. Montreal. March 15-19, 2011</li>
</ul>


<p>A large amount of research has been conducted using the Militarized Interstate Dispute dataset in order to discern what causes the onset of militarized
disputes. The majority of this research, however, has focused on structural explanations for conflict. In addition, much of the traditional political
psychology literature has focused on small-n, case study approaches in order to determine the causal processes underlying international conflict. This
focus has created a lack of large-n studies that examines the role individual leader psychology plays in the onset of a militarized dispute. With this
in mind, this paper generally expects to find a causal relationship between a leader’s psychology and the initiation of a militarized dispute. Towards
this end, this paper draws data from the years 1945-2001 and examines all cases of U.S. initiations during this time period. This paper discovers that
there is, in fact, a significant relationship between psychological characteristics and the initiation of a MID. Finally, the results of this paper
suggest a new relationship between a leader’s levels of conceptual complexity and the number of actions a leader pursues.</p>

<h2>The Effect of Leadership on Foreign Policy Decisions: A Study of Relations Between the U.S. and Iran</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association- Midwest. St. Louis, MO. November 4-7, 2010</li>
<li>Paper presented at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette Honors Invitational</li>
</ul>


<p>One of the most complex and complicated foreign policy relationships in the world is between the United States and Iran. This dyad, particularly since
the 1979 Revolution in Iran, tends to be marked by hostile rhetorical flourishes. Conventional international conflict literature points to structural
factors as the cause of hostilities. The major shortcoming of such “black-box” explanations is that they ignore a significant part of a state: the
decision makers. This paper, then, fills a hole in the extant literature on U.S.-Iranian relations by examining the role that the psychology of a U.S.
President has on hostility levels towards Iran. This paper first establishes general patterns in the data by performing a correlation between hostility
levels, as established using event data from the Penn State Event Data Project, and leader psychology. These correlations reveal significant
relationships between numerous psychological variables and hostility levels. Using these correlations as guidance, this paper then turns to individual
case analysis to determine what effect psychology has on hostility levels. After examining eight case-years, this paper is able to generally establish
that leader psychology has a significant role to play in determining hostility levels between the U.S. and Iran.</p>
