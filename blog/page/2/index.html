  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the remark on Twitter that it seemed like GDELT week due to a
<a href="http://ideas.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/10%20what_can_we_learn_from_the_last_200_million_things_that_happened_in_the_world">Foreign Policy</a>
piece about the dataset, Phil and Kalev&#8217;s <a href="http://eventdata.psu.edu/papers.dir/ISA.2013.GDELT.pdf">paper</a>
for the ISA 2013 meeting, and a <a href="https://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/the-future-of-political-science-just-showed-up/">host</a>
of <a href="http://badhessian.org/gdelt-and-social-movements/">blog</a>
<a href="https://willopines.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/excitement-about-gdelt-and-some-personal-intellectual-history/">posts</a>
about the data. So, in the spirit of GDELT week, I thought I would throw my hat into
the ring. But instead of taking the approach of lauding the new age that is approaching
for political and social research due to the monstrous scale of the data now available, I thought
I would write a little about the issues that come along with dealing with such massive data.</p>

<h3>Dealing with GDELT</h3>

<p>As someone who has spent the better part of the past 8 months dealing with the GDELT dataset,
including <a href="http://johnbeieler.org/blog/2013/04/04/how-do-i-gdelt-subsetting-and-aggregating-the-gdelt-dataset/">writing</a> a little about
working with the data, I feel that I have a somewhat unique perspective. The long and the
short of my experience is: working with data on this scale is hard. This may strike some
as obvious, especially given the cottage industry that has sprung up around Hadoop and
and other services for processing data. GDELT is 200+ million events spread across several
years. Each year of the <a href="http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/GDELT.html">reduced data</a> is in
a separate file and contains information about many, many different actors. This is part of
what makes the data so intriguing and useful, but the data is also unlike data such as the
ever-popular <a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/MIDs/MID310.html">MID data</a> in
political science that is easily managed in a program like Stata or <code>R</code>. The data requires
subsetting, massaging, and aggregating; having so much data can, at some points, become
overwhelming. What states do I want to look at? What type of actors? What type of actions?
What about substate actors? Oh, what about the dyadic interactions? These questions and
more quickly come to the fore when dealing with data on this scale. So while the GDELT
data offers an avenue to answer some existing questions, it also brings with it many
potential problems.</p>

<h3>Careful Research</h3>

<p>So, that all sounds kind of depressing. We have this new, cool dataset that could
be tremendously useful, but it also presents many hurdles. What, then, should we
as social science researchers do about it? My answer is careful theorizing and
thinking about the processes under examination. This might be a &#8220;well, duh&#8221;
moment to those in the social sciences, but I think it is worth saying when
there are some heralding <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory">&#8220;The End of Theory&#8221;</a>.
This type of large-scale data does not reduce theory and the scientific
method to irrelevance. Instead, theory is elevated to a position of
higher importance. What states do I want to look at? What type of
actions? Well, what does the theory say? As Hilary Mason noted in
a <a href="https://twitter.com/hmason/status/294930646122504192">tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data tells you whether to use A or B. Science tells you what A and B should be in the first place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Put into more social-scientific language, data tells us the relationship
between A and B, while science tells us what A and B should be and what type
of observations should be used. The data under examination in a given study
should be driven by careful consideration of the processes of interest.
This idea should not, however, be construed as a rejection of &#8220;big data&#8221; in the
social sciences. I personally believe the exact opposite; give me as many features,
measures, and observations as possible and let algorithms sort out what is important.
Instead, I think the social sciences, and science in general, is about asking
interesting questions of the data that will often require more finesse than taking an
&#8220;ANALYZE ALL THE DATA&#8221; approach. Thus, while datasets like GDELT provide new opportunities,
they are not opportunities to relax and let the data do the talking. If anything, big data
generating processes will require more work on the part of the researcher than previous
data sources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>GDELT</h3>

<p>Over the past week, the Global Data on Events, Location and Tone (GDELT)
dataset was finally released to the general public. The data is available
at the Penn State event data <a href="http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/GDELT.html">website</a>.
We at Penn State had the
good fortune to have access to this dataset for many months before its public
release. This allowed us to gain some experience working with this massive
collection of data. As a brief background, GDELT is comprised of event
data records spanning 1979 - mid 2012. The events are coded according to the
<a href="http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/cameo.html">CAMEO</a> coding scheme, with the
addition of a &#8220;QuadCategory,&#8221; which separates the events into the material conflict,
material cooperation, verbal conflict, and verbal conflict categories. The data is
spread across 33 different files, each of which is substantially large on its own.
This makes it fairly difficult to work with, and almost guarantees that some
subset of the data is necessary in order to perform analysis. Phil Schrodt has
included some programs with the data to aid in this subsetting, but I thought there
might be some who would prefer to get their hands dirty and write some of their
own code. Given this, I thought I would share some of the knowledge I gained
while working with the GDELT dataset.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this brief introduction, I will work under the assumption
that the desired events are those that originate from the United States, are
directed at some type of state actor, and are either verbal cooperation or
conflict. The following code, written in Python, demonstrates how this subset
might be selected from the GDELT data. The code also assumes the reader
has the <code>pandas</code> and <code>path</code> Python modules installed. Both can be installed using
the normal <code>pip install</code> method. Finally, the complete code is available as
a gist on <a href="https://gist.github.com/johnb30/5316196">github</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting, it is always useful to take a peek at the data. This is as
simple as opening up the terminal and using <code>head 1979.reduced.txt</code>. Doing this
shows the various columns in the reduced data and how they are arranged. We
can see that the date is in the 0 index, with <code>Actor1Code</code> and <code>Actor2Code</code>
in spots 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, <code>EventCode</code> is located in spot 3,
while the <code>QuadCategory</code> variable is, fittingly, in position 4. These indices
will prove crucial when it comes time to split and subset the data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working with some data that is spread over multiple
tab-delimited files, and is rather large (on the order of 20-30gb). The task has
been to comb through the data, and extract observations (rows) if they match
certain characteristics. Specifically, each file is iterated over and if a field
within a line matches a given value then the line should be extracted and
appended to the final output. This task is relatively straightforward in Python,
but to iterate over all of the files takes around 45 minutes. While this isn&#8217;t
an exorbiant amount of time, fast is always better. This problem is also
embarassingly parallel; the different files do not need to communicate their
results to each other, the results simply need to be stacked into a final array
in order to be saved to a file. Thus began my saga to implement a parallel
version of a script I wrote to iterate over the files and select the lines.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4237347.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>import numpy as np
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

def subset(file):
    dataOut = []
    data = open(file, 'r')
    data.readline()
    for line in data:
        splitLine = line.split('\t')
        if splitLine[3] == '57':
            dataOut.append(splitLine)
    return dataOut

def stack(list_of_data, hold_data):
    for i in xrange(len(list_of_data)):
        current = np.array(data[i])
        hold = np.vstack((hold_data, current))
    return hold

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    filepath = ['testData1.txt', 'testData2.txt']

    hold  = []
    temp = open(filepath[0], 'r')
    hold.append(temp.readline().split('\t'))
    data = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(subset)(x) for x in filepath)
    finalData = stack(data, hold)
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>As with my other posts I&#8217;ll walk through the code line by line.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1-2 Just imports. I&#8217;ll be using the <code>Parallel</code> and
<code>delayed</code> functions from the joblib module.</p></li>
<li><p>4-13 Defining the function to subset out the data. The code is fairly easy to
understand here. The file is opened, the first line is read since this
contains the column names and should not be appended to the result. Then each
line is iterated over, split on the basis of the tabs, and appended if it
meets a certain criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>15-19 Function to stack the data. The joblib <code>Parallel</code> function will return a
list of lists, with each list within the list being the results from the
individual files. The <code>stack</code> function iterates over the list, converts the
inner lists to numpy arrays, and stacks the current data with the previous
data.</p></li>
<li><p>22-28 Running the script. The main focus here is on line 27. The first
argument that <code>Parallel</code> takes is the number of jobs to be used. Setting
<code>n_jobs</code> to -1 says to use all possible cores. The second argument is the
function to be run in parallel. The joblib docs indicate that &#8220;The delayed
function is a simple trick to be able to create a tuple
(function, args, kwargs) with a function-call syntax.&#8221; So delayed is passed
the <code>subset</code> function with the arg <code>x</code>, which represents the file to be opened
as held in <code>filepath</code>. This data is then stored as a list of lists, and
stacked using the <code>stack</code> function.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Some quick prelimenary examinations shows that this parallel implementation is
much, much faster than running in serial. Running on two files is almost
instananeous, which is a drastic improvement.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following up on my last post, I wanted a way to test my bootstrapped t-test
function against the regular t-test function in R. While I was able to do this
by copy-pasting between R and a Python shell, this was less than ideal. I then
saw, however, a <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/4166681/">post</a> by Christopher
Fonnesbeck that discussed the use of the rmagic function in ipython, which can
be loaded using the %load_ext magic function. So, with this in mind, I decided
to test it out using a comparison between my bootstrap function and the
<code>t.test</code> function in R. As a note, the rmagic extension requires
<a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html">rpy2</a>, so just <code>pip install rpy2</code> and
you should be good to go.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>import bootFunction
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>%load_ext rmagic
</span><span class='line'>%R treatment = c(24,25,28,28,28,29,29,31,31,35,35,35)
</span><span class='line'>%R control = c(21,22,24,27,27,28,29,32,32)
</span><span class='line'>%Rpull treatment control
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>bootFunction.bootstrap_t_test(treatment, control, direction = "greater")
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>%R print(t.test(treatment, control, alternative = "greater"))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I first import the set of functions from the bootFunction. I then load the
rmagic extension using the <code>%load_ext</code> magic function. Using the <code>%R</code> magic
function I then defined two vectors of data, treatment and control, in the R
space. I then used <code>%Rpull</code> to pull the two vectors from the R space into the
Python shell. The two variables become structured numpy arrays.
I then perform the bootstrapped t-test as described in the earlier post.
Finally, using the <code>%R</code> magic function again, I print out the results of the
<code>t.test</code> function in R using the same data. The p-values aren&#8217;t exactly the
same, as is to be expected, but are at least within the same ballpark (the R
t-test gives .05, while the boostrap function has returned a range between .05
and .03).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1-4: Just some imports. We need the floating point division from the

<li><p>6-8: Defining a function <code>sample</code> that samples with replacement from the
dataset, creating a new dataset of the same length as the original data.
This makes use of the <code>random.choice</code> function, which samples one item
randomly from the data. This function is called the same number of times as
there are observations in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>10-17: Defining a function to perform the t-test, with two data inputs,
the number of repititions to be performed, and the direction of the
alternative hypothesis. First a 2 x <em>n</em> matrix is defined, with row 1 being
all ones and row 2 being the data. This is then flipped to create an <em>n</em> x 2
matrix. The same procedure is then repeated for the control data, except with
0s instead of 1s. These two matrices are then stacked on top of each other.
<code>tstat</code> is the difference between the two groups, and tboot is a vector of
zeros with length equal to the number of repititions for the bootstrap.</p></li>
<li><p>18-21: This for-loop actually performs the bootstrap for the number of times
indicated by <code>nboot</code>. First, a sample of the data (<code>Z</code>) is taken using the
<code>sample</code> function defined above. This is then transformed into a pandas
DataFrame, and given appropriate column names. Finally, the difference in
means of the two groups is taken for each iteration of the loop and stored in
the appropriate location in <code>tboot</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>22-28: This is simply calculating a proportion of samples that were greater or
less than the test statistic, based on the direction of the alternative
hypothesis. The final line (29) then prints the p-value as a float.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>In short, setting up Python (and other things) for scientific computing and
research can be entirely more complicated than necessary. With that said, this
aims to be a short how-to guide pointing to some resources that can make life
much easier. This post is geared towards Political Scientists coming from either
1) using R as a programming language or 2) having no programming and minimal
computing experience. Most of the things listed here have been attempted by me,
but I make no guarantees that anything will work properly or won&#8217;t mess
something up when attempted. As with anything proceed with caution and at your
own risk.</p>

<p>This how-to is mainly geared towards OS X, but many of the suggestions should
also work on Linux (and are probably easier). I don&#8217;t have any experience
setting up Windows and would probably suggest looking into dual booting Linux
(see <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">here</a> for more). Downloading Ubuntu to a CD and
setting up a dual boot is extremely easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be adding to this as I have time and think of different things that have
helped me. I know this post is long, but there is a large amount of information
to share, and I think it is easier to get a lot of it in one place, rather than
spread out.</p>
