<p>There's been a fair amount of <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/13/19439120-fasting-makes-us-stronger-cairo-protesters-carry-on-despite-ramadan?lite">discussion</a>
 in the <a href="http://www.dw.de/protests-in-turkey-continue-despite-ramadan/a-16943978">news</a>
<a href="http://world.time.com/2013/07/12/egypts-crisis-ramadan-heat-cools-tensions-in-cairo-for-now/">media</a>
recently about whether the start of Ramadan will lead to a decrease in protest
behavior in locations such as Egypt and Turkey. While I don't
have a forecast to offer, I do have data from <a href="http://gdelt.utdallas.edu">GDELT</a>
that tracks protest activity dating back to 1979. With the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ramadan100years1938-2037.png">Wikipedia</a>
I was able to identify the beginning of Ramadan going back to 1979. Using
these dates, it is then possible to plot the time series of protest behavior
with the Ramadan time period layered on top. It is important to note that
this is a rather quick and dirty analysis. For example, in 1981 Ramadan began
on July 3 so I marked July and August as Ramadan months. It shouldn't affect
the visualization all that much, but I thought it is important to note. Taken
together, this data produces the following plot (larger version available
<a href="/blog/downloads/protest_plot.png">here</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/blog/downloads/protest_plot.png"></p>

<p>A quick eyeball test seems to indicate that Ramadan often coincides with a
slightly lower level of protest activity over time. In order to shore
this up, a quick correlation of "Ramadan" with the protest data shows a
coefficient of about <code>-0.025</code>, which indicates a very weak, negative
relationship between Ramadan and protest behavior.</p>

<h3>Caveats, notes, etc.</h3>

<p>With this said, it is important to note a few things about the data. First,
this includes <strong>all</strong> protest activity over time. Events such
as the US protesting the behavior of another state are included along with
civilian protests. This data also includes protest data
from the entire globe; it is quite possible that the effects of Ramadan are
more pronounced in countries with a higher Muslim population.
A final issue is the possible presence of seasonality in the data. Ramadan
just might happen to coincide with time periods that
experience lower protest activity, e.g., the summer months.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>Since I complained on Twitter that the creators of time-series plots often fail
to upload the data used to create the time series, the
protest data is available <a href="/blog/downloads/protest_data.csv">here</a>, while the
dates for Ramadan I used are <a href="/blog/downloads/ramadan_dates.csv">here</a>.
As a final note on the data, the values for the protests are percentages of
total events that occurred in a given month. This controls for
fact that later years, particularly those after 2005 or so, have more events
due to changes in reporting, etc.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>GDELT and Protests</h3>

<p>Given the recent spate of protests around the world, there was some discussion
between <a href="http://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/">Jay Ulfelder</a>,
<a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~pxb054000/pbrandt/Home.html">Patrick Brandt</a>,
<a href="http://www.kalevleetaru.com/">Kalev Leetaru</a>,
<a href="http://eventdata.psu.edu/">Phil Schrodt</a>, and myself about the possibility of using
<a href="http://gdelt.utdallas.edu/">GDELT</a> to examine some of
the protest activity. Much of this still remains in the discussion stage, but
some data was pulled from GDELT, and I decided to venture into the world of
map making. As a caveat, I've never really worked with geographic visualization
of data, and this is my first cut at this type of work. So, without further
ado, the map is located at <a href="http://cdb.io/14RHla0">http://cdb.io/14RHla0</a>.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The data used to create the map contains all CAMEO codes that begin with <code>14</code>,
which is the general category for "protest" events, for the year 2013. Including
data from earlier than 2013 made the map much too cluttered.
A potential issue with the use of this CAMEO category is that it picks up governments protesting other governments, politicians protesting
policies, etc. Thus why the U.S. is blank; it was a shining beacon of protest
activity that distracted from the other parts of the map. If anyone is
interested I can put the U.S. data back in and regenerate the map. The data
was grouped by the latitude and longitude coordinates, and a count of protest
events at each location is included. If you zoom in, you are able to see the
individuals points, which when clicked provide information about the location
and number of events.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from this map seems to be that GDELT does a pretty good job
of capturing the broad trends of protest activity; the areas that are "bright"
are those that would generally be expected to be so.</p>

<h3>Note on Tools</h3>

<p>The map was created using the fantastic <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> along with CSS provided
by <a href="http://www.joshuastevens.net/">Josh Stevens</a></p>
