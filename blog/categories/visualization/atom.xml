    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Egypt Is Burning</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kalevleetaru.com/">Kalev Leetaru</a> pointed out to me that the
recent events in Egypt would provide another opportunity to visualize the
<a href="http://gdelt.utdallas/edu">GDELT</a> data and how it tracks the protests.
In addition, GDELT also provides the opportunity to track the government
response to the protests. My <a href="http://johnbeieler.org/protest_mapping">previous</a>
<a href="http://http://johnbeieler.org/blog/2013/07/03/mapping-protest-data/">maps</a>
only examined the presence of protest behavior across the world. For this set
of maps, however, I focus instead on Egypt alone and include various
government responses to the protest activity.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>As always, the data is pulled from the GDELT dataset. The data runs from
August 9th until the 17th, which I've used to create two separate maps. With each of
these maps, in the upper right corner you can choose the layers that appear
on the map. When both layers appear on the map, the clickable points show the
information <strong>only</strong> for the protest events. If you disable the protest layer,
you can see information for the additional violence or posture levels. Each
point includes a record of number of events, location name, and the source
URLs used to generate the events. As a note, CartoDB doesn't play nicely with
the long string of source URLs, so each URL is only separated by a space and
must be copied and pasted into a browser. Finally, it is important to note
that zooming in on the map is highly suggested; the GDELT dataset provides
a fair amount of city-level detail in the geolocation of events and it is
very interesting to see the spread of protests and government responses.</p>

<p>The first map displays protest behavior, subsetted from GDELT using root CAMEO
codes of <code>14</code>, with an overlay of violent events as red circles. The violent
events are pulled using the root CAMEO code of <code>18</code>, with the additional
stipulation that the target of the action had to be civilian in some way,
as indicated by a <code>CVL</code> label in one of the <code>Actor2Type</code> codes. This generates
the following map:</p>

<p>The second map uses the same protest data, but instead overlays CAMEO root
codes of <code>15</code>, which indicates a change in military or police posture.
This results in</p>

<iframe width='100%' height='400' frameborder='0' src='http://johnb30.cartodb.com/viz/ec0402a2-0869-11e3-86d4-3085a9a956e8/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=false&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=true&legends=true&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1%7C1&sql=&sw_lat=23.80544961231464&sw_lon=19.1162109375&ne_lat=33.22949814144951&ne_lon=47.2412109375'></iframe>


<p>I leave the substantive interpretation up to the reader, but it is worthwhile
to note that the change in military/police posture events are more widespread
than the violent events. As expected, there is also a high concentration of
violent events within Cairo.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>As with the previous maps, I made use of the great tools developed by
<a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> and CSS by
<a href="http://www.joshuastevens.net/">Josh Stevens</a>.</p>
