<div class="entry-content"><h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>In short, setting up Python (and other things) for scientific computing and
research can be entirely more complicated than necessary. With that said, this
aims to be a short how-to guide pointing to some resources that can make life
much easier. This post is geared towards Political Scientists coming from either
1) using R as a programming language or 2) having no programming and minimal
computing experience. Most of the things listed here have been attempted by me,
but I make no guarantees that anything will work properly or won&#8217;t mess
something up when attempted. As with anything proceed with caution and at your
own risk.</p>

<p>This how-to is mainly geared towards OS X, but many of the suggestions should
also work on Linux (and are probably easier). I don&#8217;t have any experience
setting up Windows and would probably suggest looking into dual booting Linux
(see <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">here</a> for more). Downloading Ubuntu to a CD and
setting up a dual boot is extremely easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be adding to this as I have time and think of different things that have
helped me. I know this post is long, but there is a large amount of information
to share, and I think it is easier to get a lot of it in one place, rather than
spread out.</p>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m going to start from the assumption that if you&#8217;re reading this you&#8217;ve never
dealt with a command-line interface, or if you have that you&#8217;ve only been
briefly exposed (maybe through things like R or Stata). So, before working with
these sorts of things it&#8217;s helpful to get acquainted with the Terminal
(Command Prompt in Windows). You should be able to find this in your
Applications folder in the Utilities folder. Go ahead and drag the app to your
dock. It will make life easier for you to have it here.</p>

<p>If you open it up you will see something like</p>

<pre><code>John-B-MacBook-Pro:~ john$ 
</code></pre>

<p>The word (john here) right before the $ is your username. There are some basic
commands for working with the Terminal:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> shows you all of the files and folders in your current working directory</li>
<li><code>ls -a</code> shows all files and folders including those that are hidden</li>
<li><code>cd</code> allows you to move from one location to another</li>
<li><code>mv</code> lets you move files</li>
<li><code>cp</code> is copying</li>
</ul>


<p>and many, many more. A basic workflow is as below:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls
Applications    Desktop     Documents

$ cd Documents
$ ls -a
test.txt    .hidden.txt

$ mv test.txt /Users/johnbeieler/Desktop
</code></pre>

<p>When in doubt Google what you want to do followed by &#8220;Terminal.&#8221; So, something
like &#8220;remove file terminal&#8221; or &#8220;copy file terminal.&#8221; A word of warning, you&#8217;re
&#8220;closer to the metal&#8221; when using a command-line interface. This means that you
have a lot of power and flexibility when working with things, but it also means
you have the ability to completely wipe your hard drive if you type the wrong
command. Be careful.</p>

<p>You should probably go ahead and install XCode. This is included on the install
CD that came with your Mac, or it can be downloaded from the Mac App Store.
Make sure that you&#8217;re using the correct version for your version of OS X.
This will install some things that will be necessary to work with later.
Linux has an awesome concept called package managers, which allow you to easily
install different applications and, well, packages by typing something like
&#8220;sudo apt-get package&#8221; into the Terminal and things are automagically downloaded
and installed. Macs lack this functionality. But! Some enterprising individuals
have come up with a way to help. By heading to
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/</a> you can
download a package manager that makes
life much easier. Feel free to look around for utilities that can be installed
using homebrew that might be of use to you. As a word of advice, if you are on
the verge of installing something, first check and see if it is available using
homebrew since brew keeps things nice and organized in your usr/local folder
instead of spread all over your computer.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>OS X comes with Python preloaded and is required by the operating system for
many functions. This is good and bad. Good since you can type</p>

<pre><code>$ python 
</code></pre>

<p>and get up and running in an interactive session. It&#8217;s also bad because the
structure of the Python installation on OS X can create some difficulties with
certain libraries. This leaves two options:
First, you can go with the default Python implementation.
This will necessitate (sort of) the use of the Scipy Superpack
<a href="http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/">http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/</a>.
The Superpack installs nearly every awesome Python library that your scientific
researcher heart could desire. As a brief rundown of what each package does:</p>

<h4>Numpy and Scipy</h4>

<p>The heart of numerical computing in Python. These two libraries give array and
matrix functions along with many other cool things. Numpy is short for Numeric
Python and Scipy is short for Scientific Python. Many other libraries in Python
are dependent on these. Much (digital) ink has been spilled on using these two
so feel free to search around for more on how an array is different than a
matrix in Numpy (hint: You should probably use an array).</p>

<h4>Matplotlib</h4>

<p>Plotting functions in Python. Allows you to make pretty graphs.</p>

<h4>IPython</h4>

<p>Stands for Interactive Python. When running python from the Terminal you should
type <code>ipython</code> instead of <code>python</code>.  IPython gives many different
magic functions and has all kinds of need goodies in it that generally make life
easier.</p>

<h4>Pandas</h4>

<p>The best thing since sliced bread and pockets on jeans. Allows the R dataframe
functionality in Python. Supports complex indexing for panel data, creation of
various statistics such as moving averages, includes various read and write
functionalities. It has some awesome documentation so go check it out.</p>

<h4>Statsmodels</h4>

<p>Statistical models in Python. This one is pretty self explanatory but is
tremendously useful and is more intuitive than R in many ways.</p>

<h4>Scikit-learn</h4>

<p>Machine learning in Python. Has some of the most comprehensive documentation
around, including a series of tutorials on how to get started with machine
learning in general.</p>

<h4>PyMC</h4>

<p>Bayesian inference in Python. MCMC and more.</p>

<h4>Other Utilities</h4>

<p>nose, readline and DateUtils. Things that are useful for other packages.
You can read up on these more if you would like. Of importance, however, is
nose. Nose is a testing suite for Python that allows you to see if anything is
wonky in your installation. You can (maybe) get away with skipping these, but
it never hurts. Look up the different tests for each of the utilities if you
want to run them.</p>

<p>In all honesty it is probably easiest to use the Superpack. The other option is
to download another Python distrubution that has all of these things included
plus a &#8220;vanilla&#8221; (non-Apple) build of Python. Some examples of these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enthought Python <a href="https://enthought.com/products/edudownload.php">https://enthought.com/products/edudownload.php</a></li>
<li>Python(x,y) <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>But really, just use the Superpack.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>There are some other things that are useful (read: necessary) to use Python in
any meaningful way. One of the most important is setuptools.</p>

<p>To install setuptools:</p>

<p>1) Go to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a>.
Download the .egg file located towards the bottom of the page. Since your
version is 2.7 you would download (as of 08/29/2012) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg.</p>

<p>2) Place it on your desktop. Do NOT change the name.</p>

<p>3) Cd to your desktop in the Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd Desktop
$ sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg 
</code></pre>

<p>4) That should be it.</p>

<p>What setuptools allows you to do is type <code>easy_install package</code> and it will
install that package for your use in Python. Some people suggest that a program
called pip is better because it has additional features such as the ability to
easily uninstall programs. To install pip you just type:</p>

<pre><code>$ easy_install pip 
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s right. Pip is installed using easy_install.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s try it out for a library called Scrapy. Scrapy is described as</p>

<blockquote><p>Scrapy is a fast high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework, used to
crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for
a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds pretty cool. All you do is open up Terminal and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ easy_install Scrapy 
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively if you&#8217;re using pip:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install Scrapy 
</code></pre>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>

<p>There are some other things that are useful to have when doing this kind of
programming/coding/scripting type work that aren&#8217;t related directly to working
with Python.</p>

<h4>Version Control</h4>

<p>First is git and github. Git is what&#8217;s called a &#8220;version control system.&#8221; Have
you ever been working on a paper and saved your work only to realize that you
wrote over some changes that you didn&#8217;t mean to? Me too. Git keeps a detailed
list of the versions of a file, including any changes or additions made to a
specific version, and allows you to roll back to a previous version. So, if you
wrote over a file and want to revert back you just have to find the version you
want.</p>

<p>Github is a &#8220;social coding platform.&#8221; It&#8217;s basically git on the internet. You&#8217;re
reading this on github right now. Normally git and github involve some (semi)
complicated Terminal commands. Github has, however, provided a nice, functional
program to use git and github. The Mac version is here <a href="http://mac.github.com/">http://mac.github.com/</a>.</p>

<h4>Text Editors</h4>

<p>Text editors can cause a surprising amount of consternation on the internet. A
decent editor can make your life easier with features such as syntax
highlighting, autoindentation, tab completion, and other features. I won&#8217;t say
which editor to use, but will give you a list of some of the big ones.
(This was written using vim, MacVim to be specific).</p>

<p><strong>Gedit:</strong> Standard on Linux distros. Simple. Includes some syntax highlighting.</p>

<p><strong>Emacs:</strong> One of the big two editors. Built on LISP. Can basically be whatever
you want it to be. Uses extensive, and sometimes complicated, key combinations
to get things done.</p>

<p><strong>Vim:</strong> The second of the big two. Has different modes such as insert and
normal. Takes some getting used to. Has a ton of different add-ons.</p>

<p><strong>Sublime Text 2:</strong> Probably more straightforward than Emacs or Vim, but more
powerful than gedit. More modern than either Emacs or Vim. Free to try for a
bit.</p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ll add a shameless plug here for some code that I wrote, py_apsrtable. This
is designed to provide easy functions to take output from Python statistical
packages and turn it into pretty LaTeX tables. To install</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install py_apsrtable
</code></pre>

<p>Documentation is on <a href="http://johnb30.github.com/py_apsrtable">github</a>.</p>

<p>I will also add as a final point that it is probably nice to take a look at
&#8220;The Zen of Python&#8221; by opening up a python shell, <code>ipython</code>, and typing</p>

<pre><code>import this
</code></pre>

<p>Next, take a look at the Python style guide contained in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out">PEP8</a>
(PythonEnhancement Proposal 8). Following these guidelines will allow your code
to be consistent with the prevailing style for Python code.</p>

<p>I know this was slightly rambling, and there are <em>numerous</em> points that I have
missed, but I hope this provides some information that will be useful to those
trying to get setup with Python for research. If you have any questions or
suggestions, please feel free to contact me.</p>
